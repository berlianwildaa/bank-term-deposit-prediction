# Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 

Term deposits are a major source of revenue for banks, but telephonic marketing campaigns require significant investment. By identifying customers who are most likely to convert, the bank can optimize its campaign strategy, improve efficiency, and increase its return on investment.

The dataset for this project is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (target variable `y`).
